# Bug Report: Payment Method Not Saved During Checkout

**ID:** BUG-008
**Title:** Selected payment method is not persisted when completing purchase
**Severity:** Critical (Payment Failure)
**Status:** Open
**Date Reported:** January 12, 2026

## 1. Description
During the checkout process, users can select a payment method (credit card, PayPal, etc.), but when they submit the order, the payment method information is not saved to the database. Orders are created without payment details, preventing proper order processing.

## 2. Steps to Reproduce
1. Add items to cart and proceed to checkout
2. Fill in shipping information
3. Select a payment method (e.g., "Credit Card")
4. Enter payment details if required
5. Complete the purchase
6. **Observe:** Order is created but payment_method field is null in database

## 3. Root Cause Analysis
The checkout form submission logic appears to be missing the payment method data in the API request payload. The frontend collects the payment method selection but fails to include it in the order creation request to the backend.

## 4. Impact
- **Business Critical:** Orders cannot be processed without payment information
- **Customer Trust:** Users may be charged but orders show as unpaid
- **Revenue Loss:** Potential failed transactions due to incomplete order data

## 5. Resolution
Update the checkout form submission to include payment method data in the order creation API call.
