# Bug Report: Admin Product Edit Changes Not Persisting

**ID:** BUG-011
**Title:** Admin users cannot save product edits - changes revert after save
**Severity:** Critical (Admin Functionality Broken)
**Status:** Open
**Date Reported:** January 12, 2026

## 1. Description
When admin users attempt to edit product details through the admin panel, the changes appear to save successfully, but upon returning to the product or refreshing the page, the original values are displayed. The database is not being updated with the new information.

## 2. Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to `/admin/products`
3. Click "Edit" on any product
4. Modify product details (name, price, description, etc.)
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. **Observe:** Success message appears
7. Navigate back to the product page or refresh
8. **Observe:** Product shows original values, not the edited ones

## 3. Root Cause Analysis
The admin product update functionality has issues with:
- API request payload not including all modified fields
- Server-side update logic failing to apply changes
- Database transaction not committing properly
- Authentication/authorization checks blocking the update

## 4. Impact
- **Admin Functionality:** Core admin capabilities are broken
- **Inventory Management:** Cannot update product information
- **Business Operations:** Unable to maintain accurate product catalog

## 5. Resolution
Debug the admin product update API endpoint, ensure all form fields are properly included in the update request, and verify database operations are completing successfully.
