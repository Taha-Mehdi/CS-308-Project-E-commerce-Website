# Bug Report: Product Review Submission Fails Silently

**ID:** BUG-010
**Title:** Users cannot submit product reviews - form submits but reviews don't appear
**Severity:** High (Feature Broken)
**Status:** Open
**Date Reported:** January 12, 2026

## 1. Description
When authenticated users attempt to submit reviews for products, the review form appears to submit successfully (no error messages), but the reviews never appear on the product page. The review count doesn't increase and submitted reviews are not visible.

## 2. Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to an account
2. Navigate to a product detail page
3. Scroll to the reviews section
4. Fill out the review form (rating and comment)
5. Click "Submit Review"
6. **Observe:** Success message appears, but review doesn't show in the list
7. Refresh the page
8. **Observe:** Review still not visible, review count unchanged

## 3. Root Cause Analysis
The review submission API call may be failing silently due to:
- Server-side validation errors not properly communicated to frontend
- Database insertion failing due to constraint violations
- Authentication token issues in the API request
- Incorrect API endpoint URL or request format

## 4. Impact
- **User Engagement:** Customers cannot share their experiences
- **Trust Issues:** Users may think their input is being ignored
- **Business Intelligence:** Lack of customer feedback for product improvement

## 5. Resolution
Investigate review submission API endpoint, add proper error handling and user feedback, and ensure successful submissions are immediately reflected in the UI.
