Cart total not updating after quantity change

**Area:** Cart Page  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Fixed

---

## Summary
When the user changes quantity using the plus/minus buttons, the subtotal updates correctly but the total at the bottom does not refresh until the page is reloaded.

---

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in as a user.
2. Add a product to the cart.
3. Go to the cart page.
4. Click + to increase quantity.
5. Observe the total at the bottom.

---

## Expected Result
Total updates immediately to reflect the new quantity.

---

## Actual Result
Total remains unchanged until page refresh.

---

## Root Cause
`useMemo` for calculating `cartTotal` had an empty dependency array, so it never recomputed when `cartItems` changed.

---

## Fix

**File:** `frontend/app/cart/page.jsx`

const cartTotal = useMemo(() => {
  return cartItems.reduce(
    (sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity,
    0
  );
}, [cartItems]); // added dependency
