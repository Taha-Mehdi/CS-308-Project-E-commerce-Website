Login does not redirect back to Cart

**Area:** Login Flow / Checkout Flow  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Fixed

---

## Summary
When a guest clicks Checkout on the cart page and is redirected to login, after logging in they are sent to the home page instead of returning to the cart.

---

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log out.
2. Add item as guest.
3. Go to cart page.
4. Click Checkout.
5. Log in.
6. Observe final redirect.

---

## Expected Result
User should return to `/cart` after successful login.

---

## Actual Result
User is redirected to `/` (home page) every time.

---

## Root Cause
`login()` in AuthContext always did `router.push("/")`, ignoring the intended destination.
