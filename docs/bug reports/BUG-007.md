# Bug Report: Product Search Returns Incorrect Results

**ID:** BUG-007
**Title:** Search functionality returns irrelevant or no results for valid queries
**Severity:** High (Core Feature Broken)
**Status:** Open
**Date Reported:** January 12, 2026

## 1. Description
The product search feature on the main products page fails to return accurate results. Users searching for specific product names or categories receive either no results or completely unrelated products, making it impossible to find desired items.

## 2. Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the products page (`/products`)
2. Enter a search term like "Air Jordan" in the search input
3. Click the search button or press Enter
4. **Observe:** Either no products are shown or products that don't match the search term appear

## 3. Root Cause Analysis
The search implementation appears to have issues with:
- Case sensitivity in database queries
- Partial string matching logic
- Category filtering combined with text search
- API endpoint not properly handling search parameters

## 4. Impact
- **User Experience:** Customers cannot find products they want to purchase
- **Sales Impact:** High likelihood of users abandoning the site due to poor search functionality
- **Support Load:** Increased customer service inquiries about product availability

## 5. Resolution
Pending investigation and fix of the search API endpoint and frontend search logic.
