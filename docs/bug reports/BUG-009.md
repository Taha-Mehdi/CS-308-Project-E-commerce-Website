# Bug Report: Wishlist Toggle Not Updating UI State

**ID:** BUG-009
**Title:** Wishlist heart icon doesn't update immediately when clicked
**Severity:** Medium (UI Inconsistency)
**Status:** Open
**Date Reported:** January 12, 2026

## 1. Description
When users click the heart icon on a product card to add/remove it from their wishlist, the UI doesn't immediately reflect the change. The icon remains in its previous state until the page is refreshed, causing confusion about whether the action was successful.

## 2. Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to products page while logged in
2. Find a product not in wishlist (empty heart)
3. Click the heart icon to add to wishlist
4. **Observe:** Heart icon doesn't change appearance immediately
5. Refresh the page
6. **Observe:** Heart now shows as filled (added to wishlist)

## 3. Root Cause Analysis
The wishlist toggle functionality appears to be making the API call correctly, but the local state management for the wishlist UI is not being updated optimistically. The component relies on server state only, without immediate local state updates for better UX.

## 4. Impact
- **User Experience:** Users are unsure if their action was successful
- **Usability:** Requires page refresh to see changes, poor interaction feedback
- **Engagement:** May discourage use of wishlist feature

## 5. Resolution
Implement optimistic UI updates for wishlist toggle actions, updating local state immediately while the API call processes in the background.
